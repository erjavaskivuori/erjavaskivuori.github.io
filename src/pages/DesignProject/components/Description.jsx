                For the project, I had to come up with a problem that I wanted
                to solve with the interactive application that I would design.
                As an active participant in cultural events myself, I have found
                that finding them requires using several different websites or
                apps. Therefore, I wanted to design an app that would allow you
                to search for cultural events in a centralised way and save both
                events and venues in your favourites. In addition, the app would
                allow you to see the events saved by friends and their reviews.
